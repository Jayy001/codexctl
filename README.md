# Codexctl
A utility program that helps to manage the remarkable device version utilizing [ddvks update server](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-update) 

## Caveat for downgrading to a version below 3.11 

If your reMarkable device is above 3.11 and you want to downgrade to a version below 3.11, codexctl cannot do this currently. Please refer to #71 for manual instructions.

## Installation 

You can find pre-compiled binaries on the [releases](https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl/releases/) page. This includes a build for the reMarkable itself, as well as well as builds for linux, macOS, and Windows. Alternatively, you can install directly from pypi with `pip install codexctl`. Codexctl currently only has support for a **command line interfaces** but a graphical interface is soon to come.

Finally, if you want to build it yourself, you can run `make executable` which requires python 3.11 or newer, python-venv and pip. Linux also requires libfuse-dev.
